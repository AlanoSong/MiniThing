1. The root cause of high cpu usage ratio ?

    multi-thread dead loop
    debug / release build

2. How many threads work after sqlite database built ?

    UpdateSqlDataBaseThread
    MonitorThread * VolNum
    QueryThread <cmd mode only>

3. First try to sleep UpdateSqlDataBaseThread for a while

    under debug build

    before: 29-31%
    after:  26-29% // Sleep 100 ms
            15-24% // Sleep 500 ms

    -> so loop sleep in thread working is usable

3. It may readuce thread performance, or lost data in monitor thread ?

4. Try to sleep MonitorThread * VolNum

    under debug build
    MonitorThread * 4

    before: 13-23%
    after:  0-22%, 0% mostly // Sleep 100 ms each monitor thread

5. Will monitor thread lost data when sleep ?

    to be confirm
